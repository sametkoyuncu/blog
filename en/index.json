[{"content":"What Is Hugo? Hugo is an open-source tool known as a static site generator. It converts Markdown files into HTML pages within seconds and lets you deploy them to platforms such as Netlify, GitHub Pages, or Cloudflare with a single action.\nThat means you do not need a database, PHP, or a traditional server stack like WordPress. Everything is pre-rendered and delivered to the browser as static files, which keeps Hugo projects both fast and secure.\nWhy Use Hugo? ⚡️ 1. Speed Hugo’s biggest advantage is its build speed. Even sites with thousands of posts compile in just a few seconds, thanks to Hugo being written in Go.\n🧱 2. Simplicity To add new content you simply run:\nhugo new posts/new-article.md and then edit the resulting Markdown file. Even non-developers can create content with minimal effort.\n🪶 3. Lightweight and Secure Because there is no server-side code:\nThere is virtually no risk of SQL injection or widespread exploits. Pages are prebuilt, so they load extremely quickly. 🌐 4. Multilingual Support and Themes Hugo ships with built-in multilingual features—ideal for Turkish–English blogs—and offers hundreds of ready-to-use themes. One of the most popular is PaperMod, known for its modern look, speed, and SEO-friendly defaults.\nHow Does Hugo Work? In short:\nIt reads your Markdown (.md) files. It applies the HTML templates provided by your theme. It outputs static assets into the public/ directory. Publishing those files to a host such as GitHub Pages takes the site live. There is no need for a database or backend layer—everything happens at build time.\nWhat Is Hugo Used For? Personal blogs (like this one). Documentation sites, including SDK and API guides. Portfolio or landing pages. Small business websites. A professional showcase: https://gohugo.io/ — Hugo’s own site is built with Hugo.\nWhen Not to Choose Hugo? When you depend on highly dynamic content such as user accounts, comments, or checkout flows. When you need backend logic or continuously updated data. In those cases, hybrid frameworks like Next.js, Astro, or SvelteKit are usually a better fit. For content-focused blogs or documentation sites, though, Hugo remains the fastest and simplest option.\nSummary: Hugo in 5 Sentences It is an open-source static site generator written in Go.
