## What Is Hugo?

Hugo is an open-source tool known as a **static site generator**. It converts Markdown files into HTML pages within seconds and lets you deploy them to platforms such as Netlify, GitHub Pages, or Cloudflare with a single action.

That means you do not need a database, PHP, or a traditional server stack like WordPress. Everything is **pre-rendered** and delivered to the browser as static files, which keeps Hugo projects both **fast** and **secure**.

## Why Use Hugo?

### ⚡️ 1. Speed

Hugo’s biggest advantage is its build speed. Even sites with thousands of posts compile in **just a few seconds**, thanks to Hugo being written in Go.

### 🧱 2. Simplicity

To add new content you simply run:

```bash
hugo new posts/new-article.md
```

and then edit the resulting Markdown file. Even non-developers can create content with minimal effort.

### 🪶 3. Lightweight and Secure

Because there is no server-side code:

- There is virtually no risk of SQL injection or widespread exploits.
- Pages are prebuilt, so they load extremely quickly.

### 🌐 4. Multilingual Support and Themes

Hugo ships with built-in multilingual features—ideal for Turkish–English blogs—and offers hundreds of ready-to-use themes. One of the most popular is PaperMod, known for its modern look, speed, and SEO-friendly defaults.

## How Does Hugo Work?

In short:

1. It reads your Markdown (`.md`) files.
2. It applies the HTML templates provided by your theme.
3. It outputs static assets into the `public/` directory.
4. Publishing those files to a host such as GitHub Pages takes the site live.

There is no need for a database or backend layer—everything happens at build time.

## What Is Hugo Used For?

- Personal blogs (like this one).
- Documentation sites, including SDK and API guides.
- Portfolio or landing pages.
- Small business websites.

A professional showcase: https://gohugo.io/ — Hugo’s own site is built with Hugo.

## When Not to Choose Hugo?

- When you depend on highly dynamic content such as user accounts, comments, or checkout flows.
- When you need backend logic or continuously updated data.

In those cases, hybrid frameworks like Next.js, Astro, or SvelteKit are usually a better fit. For content-focused blogs or documentation sites, though, Hugo remains the fastest and simplest option.
